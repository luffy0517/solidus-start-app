# Solidus Starter Frontend development information
This document aims to give some extra information for developers that are going 
to contribute to our `solidus_starter_frontend` component.

### Running the sandbox

You can run `bin/sandbox` to create a sandboxed Solidus application. The
storefront of the app would be generated by this template. The path for the
sandbox app is `./sandbox`.

`bin/rails` will forward any Rails commands to `sandbox/bin/rails`.

Here's an example:

```
$ bin/rails server
=> Booting Puma
=> Rails 6.0.2.1 application starting in development
* Listening on tcp://127.0.0.1:3000
Use Ctrl-C to stop
```

Default username and password for admin are: `admin@example.com` and `test123`.

You can run `bin/guard` to sync changes from the templates directory to the
sandbox. Please see the Guardfile for the configuration.

### Docker development

If you are a docker user you can wake up the project as usual with:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Wait for all the dependencies to be installed. You can check progress with `docker-compose logs -f app`.

Then you can dispatch commands to the `app` container:

```bash
docker-compose exec app bin/rails server
```

When running the [sandbox application](#running-the-sandbox), take into account
that you need to bind to `0.0.0.0`. By default, port `3000` is exposed but you
can changed it through `SANDBOX_PORT` environment variable:

```bash
SANDBOX_PORT=4000 docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec app bin/sandbox
docker-compose exec app bin/rails server --binding 0.0.0.0 --port 4000
```
